## POC RCS client for Google Messages service

This repo provides a mini Python RCS (Rich Communication Services) client to impersonate and interact with Google Message server (https://jibe.google.com).

The code worked with Google Message in 2019.  However, I do not expect the code to work as-is in 2024.  I no longer maintain this project.
